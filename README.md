# CalculatorApp

This is a simple calculator application.

This calculator application can do basic functions such as:

Adding 
Subtracting 
Multiplying 
Dividing

You can also continue manipulating your answers with any function instead of having to input your answer again.

For example:

2 x 2 = 4 + 3 = 7 - 4 = 3 ... etc.

Also,

Instead of clearing the results every time you press the equal sign, you can just press any number to start a new equation.

For example:

(Old way)

2 + 2 = 4 
[CE] 
3 + 2 = 5 
[CE]

(Now) 
2 + 2 = 4 
3 + 2 = 5

There is no need to press [CE] unless you've made a mistake in inputting numbers.
